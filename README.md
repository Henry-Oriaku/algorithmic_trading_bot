# Update August 2023: Tradeoxy.com
I could never have imagined how popular this series would become. It became so popular, I launched a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1sfWAyk-48pGy58lgehKFA), and got ton's of comments, people reaching out, etc. 

What I found was that many of my readers/viewers were spending tens of hours configuring their environment, before even getting to building an algorithm 

**I wanted to change this situation!**

As a result, I've now launched [Tradeoxy.com](https://www.tradeoxy.com/). This platform brings together things:
- Powerful API's to drastically simplify algorithm development
- Education, through free and paid courses and YouTube videos
- Supportive community where everyone helps each other

Currently we are in the build/early access stage, and we would love you to join our journey (also, it's currently free!)

To join us, head to [Tradeoxy.com](https://www.tradeoxy.com/)
